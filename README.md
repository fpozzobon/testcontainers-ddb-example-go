# testcontainers-ddb-example-go
Example of usage of testcontainers integrated with dynamodb using [testcontainers-go localstack module](github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/modules/localstack).

The example is compatible with Podman by setting environment variable prior to the test.
Environment variables can be set globally for all tests instead if preferred.
